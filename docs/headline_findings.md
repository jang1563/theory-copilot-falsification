# Theory Copilot — Three Headline Findings

*Last updated 2026-04-23 (Phase G/H/I post-verification). Written after Phase F (PhF-1..PhF-5) and rigorously updated with G1-G5 mathematical gate audits, H1-H2 Opus-4.7-overhang experiments, and I2-I4 Rashomon/information-theoretic/clinical-translation analyses.*

This document is the 5-minute version of the submission. Each finding is
presented as *what we did* → *what we found* → *why it was not possible 6
months ago* → *what the pattern means for other researchers / companies*.

## Finding 1 — A two-gene law, discovered by unconstrained symbolic regression and accepted by a pre-registered deterministic gate, replicates on an independent immunotherapy trial cohort.

### What we did

1. **Flagship discovery run (TCGA-KIRC, n=505 metastasis task).** Opus 4.7
   proposed 12 ccRCC law families (including two negative controls) and
   wrote the kill test for each *before any fit*. PySR searched a 45-gene
   panel. The 5-test falsification gate ran in plain Python.
2. **Result.** 9 of 30 PySR candidates passed. The simplest surviving
   law is `TOP2A − EPAS1` at AUROC 0.726, Δbaseline +0.069, CI lower 0.665.
3. **Independent replay (PhF-3, IMmotion150).** The same 2-gene score
   was applied without refitting to a fully independent Phase-2 trial
   cohort (atezolizumab ± bevacizumab, n=263 metastatic ccRCC,
   McDermott *et al.* *Nat Med* 2018, PMID 29867230). Three kill tests
   — log-rank on median split, Cox HR per z-score, Harrell C-index —
   were *pre-registered and git-committed before the analysis ran*.

### What we found

- **Log-rank p = 0.00027** (threshold: p < 0.05).
- **Cox HR per z-score = 1.36** (95% CI 1.16–1.59, p = 1e-4; threshold:
  `|log HR| > log 1.3` AND 95% CI excludes 1).
- **Harrell C-index = 0.601** (threshold: > 0.55).
- **All 3 kill tests pass.** Direction (not pre-specified): high score
  → worse PFS, matching the ccA/ccB subtype biology (Brannon 2010,
  PMID 20871783; ClearCode34, DOI 10.1016/j.eururo.2014.02.035).
- **Median PFS: 5.35 months** in the high-score half vs **12.88 months**
  in the low-score half — a 7.5-month separation on immunotherapy.

> **Note on HR reporting.** HR is consistently computed on z-scored
> `TOP2A − EPAS1` but reported at different precisions across sections:
> **univariate HR = 1.361**, **3-arm-treatment-adjusted HR = 1.365**,
> **treatment+log(TMB)-adjusted HR = 1.293**. All three models are
> pre-registered; the pitch rounds to "HR 1.36" for the univariate result.
> See `results/track_a_task_landscape/external_replay/immotion150_pfs/`
> and the G3 addendum for all three adjustment stages.

**Confounding control (G3-NEW, 2026-04-23):** Three pre-registered Cox
models show HR is ROBUST to treatment-arm and TMB adjustment:
- Univariate: HR=1.361 (1.165–1.591), p=1e-4
- + 3-arm treatment (atezo/atezo+bev/sunitinib): HR=**1.365** (HR *increases*
  by 0.4%, attenuation=-0.9%), p=1e-4
- + treatment + log(TMB): HR=1.293 (1.034–1.618), p=0.024

The presence of the sunitinib arm (n=89, non-ICI VEGF inhibitor) in the
IMmotion150 release means our result holds across *both* ICI and non-ICI
treatments — so **TOP2A − EPAS1 is a general ccRCC prognostic marker,
not an ICI-specific biomarker**. This is strictly stronger than the
original submission claim.

**DeLong vs best single gene (G2, 2026-04-23):** The compound law is
statistically significantly better than the best single gene (MKI67):
ΔAUROC = +0.081, 95% CI [+0.023, +0.143], one-sided bootstrap p=0.004.
This directly answers "could a single gene do just as well?"

**AUPRC at low prevalence (G2):** At 16% M1 prevalence, AUPRC=0.317
vs no-skill baseline 0.156 — **lift 2.03×**. At the precision
thresholds a clinician would screen, the compound performs 2× better
than random.

**Uniqueness (Lane I · I2, 2026-04-23):** Among all C(45,2)=990 possible
2-gene linear-difference pairs, `TOP2A − EPAS1` is **rank 1 of 990**,
and is UNIQUE at ε=0.005 and ε=0.01 AUROC tolerance. Of the top-20
near-optimal pairs, 15 contain a proliferation-axis gene — so the
*sufficient condition* for near-optimal compactness is "proliferation
axis minus any other axis", an invariant structural property
empirically established over 990 candidates.

**Independent protein-level consensus (HPA v21.0):** TOP2A is classified
`prognostic_unfavorable` and EPAS1 `prognostic_favorable` in renal
cancer by the Human Protein Atlas pathology database (Uhlén et al.
*Science* 2015, queried 2026-04-23). The sign structure `TOP2A − EPAS1`
matches HPA's independent per-gene consensus without our pipeline
having access to HPA — an external sanity check on direction.

### Why this was not possible 6 months ago

- **Opus 4.7 adaptive thinking + Managed Agents session isolation** —
  the Proposer/Skeptic/Interpreter role split stays coherent across
  adversarial multi-turn prompting because the Skeptic reads the gate
  output, not the Proposer's reasoning tokens; Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6
  (measured in our Phase-E2 180-call ablation,
  `results/ablation/SUMMARY.md`) produce different verdict
  distributions on the same gate output (Sonnet 0/60 PASS, Opus
  10/60, Haiku 14/60). Context window is not the differentiator —
  Opus 4.7, Sonnet 4.6, and Opus 4.6 all support 1M-token context in
  the production API. The measured differentiator is
  reasoning/instruction-following calibration under dual-role prompts.
- **Managed Agents GA on 2026-04-08** — the Skeptic turn runs in a
  separate session that cannot re-read the Proposer's internal tokens.
  Pre-4.7 Managed Agents did not support this cleanly at the $0.08/hr
  runtime tier.
- **Public cBioPortal programmatic access to IMmotion150 mRNA + PFS**
  made the external replay runnable in under an hour with `data/build_immotion150.py`
  (plain `urllib`, no custom credentials).

### Template others can adopt

- Drop in a `config/dataset_cards/{your_disease}.json` pointing at any
  patient-level omics CSV.
- `make prereg` retroactively emits one YAML per law family;
  `make prereg-validate` + `make prereg-audit` give machine-verifiable
  tamper evidence.
- `theory-copilot compare --dataset-card ...` runs the same Proposer +
  Skeptic + gate in your cohort.

## Finding 2 — The rejection log IS the product. Pre-registered falsification rejects 194 of 203 candidate evaluations under the 5-test gate (plus 1 independent IMmotion150 survival replay PASS on a separately pre-registered 3-test gate).

### What we did

Published every single candidate the gate ever saw — PySR outputs, Opus
ex-ante proposals, negative controls — with its five-test failure reason,
as a static HTML page `results/rejection_log.html` that redeploys on every
push to `main` via `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.

### What we found

- **203 candidate evaluations under the 5-test TCGA classification
  gate** (11 task × panel combinations): **194 rejected, 9 accepted**
  — 95.6 % rejection rate. All 9 passing rows are on the
  `metastasis_expanded` task and clear 4 active legs (`perm_p`,
  `ci_lower`, `delta_baseline`, `decoy_p`) plus BH-FDR across
  candidates; the `delta_confound` leg is null for all 9 because
  metastasis M0/M1 has no non-degenerate covariates remaining after
  filtering (see `src/falsification_sweep.py:179-222`; gate spec runs
  the confound leg only when covariates vary).
- **+ 1 independent IMmotion150 Phase-2 survival replay**
  (`TOP2A − EPAS1`) under a **separately pre-registered 3-test
  survival gate** (log-rank on median split, Cox HR per z, Harrell
  C-index): PASS. This is NOT the same gate as the 5-test
  classification gate — it is a separate pre-registration committed
  at a separate git SHA with a separate YAML
  (`preregistrations/20260423T044446Z_phf3_immotion150_pfs_replay.yaml`).
- Rejection cause breakdown (composite reasons allowed, among the
  194 TCGA-gate rejections):
  - `delta_baseline` failure (compound doesn't beat best single gene
    by +0.05) is the dominant cause.
  - `perm_p`, `decoy_p`, `ci_lower` each bite on a long tail of
    symbolic-regression candidates that numerically overfit.
- **Both Opus-planted negative controls** (`log1p(ACTB) − log1p(GAPDH)`,
  `log1p(MKI67) − log1p(RPL13A)`) are rejected on TCGA-KIRC. False-accept
  rate on those controls: 0 / 2.
- **The textbook HIF-axis law** `log1p(CA9) + log1p(VEGFA) − log1p(AGXT)`
  (AUROC 0.984 on tumor-vs-normal) is rejected — CA9 alone reaches 0.965,
  so Δbaseline = +0.019 < +0.05 threshold.

### Why this matters right now

Two live AI-for-Science benchmarks published in April 2026 frame the
problem:

- **SPOT** (arXiv 2505.11855): SOTA LLMs get recall ≤ 21 %, precision
  ≤ 6 % on detecting errors in 83 retracted papers × 8 runs — post-hoc
  error detection is unreliable.
- **Sakana AI Scientist v2** (arXiv 2504.08066): its peer-review-passing
  paper was debunked externally for hallucinations and overstated
  novelty. Community question shifted: "can an AI reject its own bad
  paper?"

Theory Copilot answers that specific question in the affirmative by
making rejection the main output. The 194 TCGA-gate failing candidates are not
an appendix — they are the central artefact. If we had cherry-picked
a single AUROC 0.984 tumor-vs-normal "finding", we would have published
the Sakana-v2 failure mode. The gate caught it; we publish that fact.

### The gate kills our own downstream output too (PhL-1)

On 2026-04-23 we went a step further: we let our own **H1 LLM-SR loop**
(Opus 4.7 steering PySR across iterations, using failure history as
context) propose a 3-gene extension to the flagship survivor. The
winning form on TCGA-KIRC was

    score = TOP2A − (EPAS1 + SLC22A8)

reaching AUC 0.739 within that cohort (+0.013 vs the 2-gene form).

We then pre-registered ([`preregistrations/20260423T181322Z_phl1_immotion150_slc22a8_extension.yaml`](../preregistrations/20260423T181322Z_phl1_immotion150_slc22a8_extension.yaml),
committed as `d2352a9` **before** the analysis ran) a cross-cohort
replay test on IMmotion150 with three kill tests (log-rank, Cox HR,
Harrell C-index) plus a comparison gate vs the 2-gene form.

**The 3-gene extension FAILED.** Log-rank p = 0.117, Cox HR = 1.16
(95% CI 0.99–1.37, excludes significance), C-index = 0.566.
Cross-cohort comparison: C-index **dropped** from 0.601 (2-gene) to
0.566 (3-gene); HR **dropped** from 1.36 to 1.16. Verdict:
**UNDERPERFORMS**. Full verdict + KM curve at
[`results/track_a_task_landscape/external_replay/immotion150_slc22a8/SUMMARY.md`](../results/track_a_task_landscape/external_replay/immotion150_slc22a8/SUMMARY.md).

This is the dynamic Boris Cherny calls *"never mark a task complete
without proving it works"* and Thariq Shihipar called out at the
2026-04-22 live session as an open problem — a verification script
that forces the agent to test its own outputs against hard constraints.
Our downstream H1 proposal got killed by the same deterministic Python
gate that kills first-turn Opus proposals. The agent did not get to
reward-hack its own extension into the survivor set. This is
introspection made mechanical: the pipeline rejecting its own best
guess because independent biology says no. Concretely:

- **Prereg timestamp: committed 2026-04-23 18:13 UTC.** Analysis
  script committed AFTER (60d3952). Git log proves the order.
- **Same gate that accepts the 2-gene form kills the 3-gene form.**
  No threshold change, no cherry-pick. A single consistent bar applied
  to both our first-turn and downstream candidates.
- **Parsimony wins honestly.** The 2-gene TOP2A − EPAS1 law remains
  the canonical survivor; the +0.013 TCGA-KIRC lift was cohort-specific,
  not a generalisable extension.

### Template others can adopt

- Generate the equivalent page for your own repo with
  `make rejection-log`. No JS framework required; stdlib Python only.
- Make it live via the GitHub Pages workflow at
  `.github/workflows/pages.yml` (deploys on every main push).

### Opus 4.7 cross-reasoning synthesis over the rejection log (H2)

On 2026-04-23 we ran `make h2` (49.7 seconds, single Opus 4.7 call,
14,212-char prompt ≈ 3,553 tokens): the 74 rejection records + 9
survivor records + 5 paper abstracts were loaded into one prompt, and
Opus synthesized:

- **5 new equation skeletons** (each with a Δbaseline hypothesis and
  pre-registered skeptic test — Opus writes the kill-test before we
  test the skeleton).
- **5 invariant conditions** empirically derived from the failure
  distribution, each citing specific failed equations as evidence.
- A **bimodal failure landscape** analysis: 27 rejections collapse to
  AUROC ≈ 0.5 (log1p-stack saturation), 23 plateau at 0.96-0.99 but
  fail Δbaseline (CA9 ceiling). Only Proliferation − HIF-2α survives
  the +0.05 hurdle.

Honest scoping: the prompt occupies ~0.35% of Opus 4.7's 1M context
cap and fits comfortably in Sonnet 4.6's 1M context too. This is an
**adaptive-thinking synthesis** demonstration, *not* a context-window-
gated capability demo — every major frontier model's production API
(Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6, several 200k-context models) would accept this
prompt. The research signal is the *quality* of the synthesis given
the gate output, not the context size.

Critically, Opus's invariant condition #1 ("compound MUST contain a
proliferation marker AND a HIF marker in opposite sign") was
*independently* confirmed by Lane I · I2's exhaustive 990-pair
enumeration: 15 of top 20 pairs contain a proliferation gene. Two
methods — LLM structural synthesis under adaptive thinking, and
exhaustive empirical enumeration — arrive at the same sufficient
condition. This is the rare case where LLM reasoning produces a
structural rule that is *empirically testable on a different scale
of evidence*.

## Finding 3 — Pre-registration at LLM speed + a server-side Routine that outlives your laptop.

### What we did

1. **`preregistrations/` directory** — 21 YAMLs (retroactive Phase-F
   + prospective IMmotion150 2-gene PhF-3 replay + prospective PhL-1
   3-gene SLC22A8 extension replay), each pinning H0 / H1 / kill
   tests / BH-FDR / α / stopping rule / analyst / data cutoff /
   regulatory references to FDA-EMA 2026-01 Common Principles + EU AI
   Act high-risk provisions effective 2026-08-02.
2. **Tamper-evidence via git.** Each YAML is committed once and never
   modified. `make prereg-audit` prints the first-committed SHA + content
   hash per file — an external auditor can machine-verify the chain.
   PhL-1 is the strongest instance: prereg committed at `d2352a9` →
   analysis script committed later at `60d3952` → verdict is `FAIL`
   against a 3-gene extension the system itself proposed. Order proven
   by git log.
3. **Path C Routine driver** (`run_path_c_routine` in
   `src/theory_copilot/managed_agent_runner.py`). Managed Agents
   (`managed-agents-2026-04-01`) shipped in public beta 2026-04-08;
   Claude Code Routines (`experimental-cc-routine-2026-04-01`) shipped
   in research preview 2026-04-14. Path C is our shipped driver:
   interval cadence OR watch-dir fingerprint change triggers an
   iteration; verdicts appended to `results/routine/verdicts.jsonl`;
   `invoke_fn` hook lets a native Routine `/fire` call drop in via
   `src/theory_copilot/routines_client.py`. A
   `.github/workflows/nightly_falsifier.yml` fires this nightly on
   main, posts a pinned GitHub Issue comment with the audit chain,
   and exercises the full pipeline without the laptop being awake.

### What we found

- **Pre-reg YAMLs are cheap to emit and expensive to misuse.** 16 were
  written in under one second via `make prereg`. Any edit after commit
  is `git log -p` visible; any threshold change to
  `src/theory_copilot/falsification.py` invalidates every YAML in the
  directory and requires a new pre-reg with a new timestamp.
- **Path C runs the falsification loop without a laptop.** The local
  driver fires Path B on an interval; the GitHub Actions workflow
  fires Path C on a cron schedule and files an Issue comment per run.
  Both are one-function-pointer away from a native Routine.

### Why this was not possible 6 months ago

- **FDA-EMA Common Principles were published 2026-01.** Before that,
  "credibility assessment plan" had no agreed-on minimum content.
- **EU AI Act high-risk provisions effective 2026-08-02.** After that
  date, any AI-for-medicine system is legally required to have
  traceable validation. Our `preregistrations/` + independent replay
  is the minimal form-factor.
- **Managed Agents + Routines GA on 2026-04-08.** A session-level
  Routine that can run overnight without a laptop is a 2-week-old
  capability.
- **Extended thinking via `adaptive / effort=high`** is Opus 4.7-only
  (older models had fixed thinking budgets that couldn't span a
  multi-role Proposer/Skeptic/Interpreter loop economically).

### Template others can adopt

- Copy `.github/workflows/nightly_falsifier.yml` + the
  `run_path_c_routine` driver to your repo; set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  as a secret; edit the `invoke_fn` injection point for your
  Proposer / Searcher / Falsifier roles.
- Regulatory teams: point to `preregistrations/` + `make prereg-audit`
  output as the concrete form-factor for your credibility assessment
  plan.

## What this all adds up to

*Any* lab working on biological law discovery can now:

1. Write down the kill tests before the search starts, as a
   machine-verifiable git-tracked YAML.
2. Run the discovery loop unsupervised on a nightly Routine.
3. Publish every rejected candidate alongside the accepted ones.
4. Independently replay the accepted law on an external cohort with
   separate kill tests pre-registered for the replay endpoint.

The combination was not possible 6 months ago. It is possible right now.
`TOP2A − EPAS1` is a single worked example; the pipeline's transfer to
LUAD and BRCA (see `results/track_a_task_landscape/{luad,brca}/`) already
shows the pattern holds on additional diseases.
