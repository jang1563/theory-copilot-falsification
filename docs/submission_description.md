# Theory Copilot — Submission Description

## Project Summary

Theory Copilot is a falsification-first biological discovery loop
powered by Opus 4.7. Opus 4.7 plays three roles around a deterministic
statistical gate: a Scientist that proposes compact symbolic law
families (with pathway-level rationale and an ex-ante negative
control), a Skeptic that reviews each candidate's metric pattern
after the gate has run, and an Interpreter that writes a mechanism
hypothesis for the survivors. The gate itself — two-sided permutation
null, bootstrap CI lower bound, sign-invariant single-feature
baseline, incremental covariate confound, decoy-feature null, with
Benjamini-Hochberg FDR across candidates — is plain Python, so Opus
4.7 cannot rationalize its own proposals into passing.

Applied to real TCGA-KIRC, the gate rejects 100+ candidates across
tumor-vs-normal, stage, and survival tasks on an 11-gene HIF-axis
panel (each task is saturated by a single gene; compound laws cannot
clear the pre-registered +0.05 `delta_baseline` threshold). On a
45-gene expanded panel the same gate accepts 9 / 30 candidates on
metastasis, centred on **`TOP2A − EPAS1`** — proliferation minus
HIF-2α — which reproduces the published ccA-vs-ccB ccRCC subtype
axis from unconstrained symbolic regression, without being seeded
with it. What gets reported is only what the gate failed to reject,
and the accept-reject pair on the same infrastructure is the
artifact.

## Opus 4.7 Usage

- **Extended thinking** via `thinking={"type": "adaptive",
  "display": "summarized"}` plus `output_config={"effort": "high"}`
  on every Scientist / Skeptic / Interpreter call. `budget_tokens`
  removed (400 on Opus 4.7); `effort` is the control knob.
- **Multi-role adversarial reasoning.** The same model authors both
  the proposal and the ex-ante skeptic test, then writes the
  post-hoc review of the statistical gate's verdict, then writes the
  mechanism interpretation of the survivor — four Opus 4.7 calls
  around one deterministic gate.
- **Multi-step discovery loop.** Proposal → Search → Falsification
  → Survivor → Replay. The Proposer's output is the Skeptic's
  input; the Skeptic's per-metric critique is the Interpreter's
  input; the Interpreter's hypothesis is replayed on the held-out
  test split (and, where possible, an independent cohort).

Live transcripts of all four roles at `results/live_evidence/`.

## Claude Managed Agents Usage

- **Three-agent architecture:** `Proposer` (Opus 4.7, extended
  thinking), `Searcher` (local PySR, no API), `Falsifier` (Opus 4.7,
  extended thinking). Clean role separation, structured
  PASS / FAIL / NEEDS_MORE_TESTS verdicts.
- **Path B — public-beta, fully implemented and live-verified.**
  A single Managed Agent with `agent_toolset_20260401` drives the
  Night-2 / Night-3 / Night-4 tasks via structured tool calls. End-
  to-end verification at
  `results/live_evidence/04_managed_agents_e2e.log`
  (`agents.create` → `environments.create` → `sessions.create` →
  `stream` → `send` → `session.status_idle`).
- **Path A — `callable_agents`, waitlist-gated.** Three sequential
  sessions in a shared environment, each receiving the previous
  agent's output as part of its user message. Guarded by
  `MANAGED_AGENTS_WAITLIST=approved`; flips on when the multiagent
  research-preview is granted.

## Prize Category Justification

- **Keep Thinking ($5K).** The load-bearing cognitive work is the
  ex-ante skeptic test written before any fit, the four-role review
  loop, and the post-hoc metric-pattern interpretation. All three
  require the Skeptic stance to survive against the model's own
  Proposer output. Smaller models collapse to rubber-stamp
  agreement on the Skeptic turn. Adaptive thinking with
  `effort=high` is what keeps the tension live long enough to emit
  a dissent or a well-defended PASS.
- **Best Claude Managed Agents ($5K).** Explicit multi-agent
  delegation with biological domain specialization per agent
  (Proposer knows pathway biology, Searcher knows symbolic
  regression, Falsifier knows statistics). Both delegation paths
  implemented against the verified 2026-04-01 API. Path B runs
  live; Path A is one flag-flip away.

## What We Built

- `src/theory_copilot/falsification.py` — 5-test statistical gate.
- `src/theory_copilot/opus_client.py` — three-role Opus 4.7 wrapper
  with adaptive thinking, JSON-fence-tolerant parser, cost ledger.
- `src/theory_copilot/managed_agent_runner.py` — Path A + Path B.
- `src/theory_copilot/cli.py` — `theory-copilot compare` + `replay`.
- `src/pysr_sweep.py` — PySR 1.5.9 sweep with law-family injection,
  train/test split, novelty scoring.
- `src/falsification_sweep.py` — BH-FDR batch falsification.
- `src/track_a_survivor_robustness.py` — Sci-B methodology applied
  to the survivor (6 axes + 5-fold CV).
- Track B robustness scripts (`src/gate_sensitivity.py`,
  `src/track_b_*.py`) — 6-axis stress test of the reject verdict.
- Opus-proposed `config/law_proposals.json` (14 law family templates,
  7 for KIRC + 2 ex-ante negative controls) used to seed PySR.
- Real public data pipeline: TCGA-KIRC (GDC star_tpm, 609 samples,
  with 11-gene and 45-gene derivatives) + GSE40435 (microarray,
  202 paired samples).
- Offline synthetic-data test suite so the pipeline reproduces
  without API credentials.

## Technical Novelty

Most AI-for-Science pipelines optimize for hit rate: propose, fit,
report whatever cleared a threshold. Theory Copilot inverts the
incentive — a proposal only counts if a pre-registered five-test
gate fails to reject it, and the thresholds are written down before
any fit. Confirmation bias is engineered out of the loop rather
than hoped against. The Managed Agents implementation enforces this
at the architecture level by making the Scientist, Searcher, and
Falsifier literally separate agents with separate system prompts —
Opus 4.7 cannot let a proposal pass by rephrasing its defence.

The twin outcome on the same infrastructure — the gate rejecting
textbook HIF-axis biology (`log1p(CA9) + log1p(VEGFA) − log1p(AGXT)`
fails on tumor-vs-normal because CA9 alone saturates at AUROC
0.965) and the gate accepting an unseen compact law
(`TOP2A − EPAS1` on metastasis, AUROC 0.726, `Δbase = +0.069`, cluster
of 9 survivors reading as the published ccA/ccB subtype axis) — is
the artifact. Both outcomes are reproducible end-to-end from the
committed data + `make audit` + `make test` + `make demo-kirc`.

## Broader Program Context

This hackathon artifact is the Opus 4.7-centered proof-of-concept of
a larger research program — **NegBioDB**, a structured database
aggregating ~32.8 million confirmed negative biomedical results
(drug–target inactives, failed clinical trials, protein non-
interactions, non-essential genes, benign variants) paired with
benchmarks for how publication bias propagates into ML / LLM
predictions. Theory Copilot operationalizes NegBioDB's core thesis
— that falsification is the expensive, neglected half of scientific
inference — as a runnable Opus 4.7 loop on real cancer-genomics data.
