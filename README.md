# Theory Copilot: Falsification-Aware Biological Law Discovery

Theory Copilot Discovery is a falsification-aware biological law discovery workflow built around Opus 4.7. Instead of celebrating the first high-scoring equation, the system proposes compact law families, searches for concrete candidates, attacks them with a five-test statistical gate, and only reports what survives. On real TCGA-KIRC the gate **rejects 194 of 204 candidates** across six task × panel combinations (each task dominated by a single gene) **and** accepts 10 on metastasis with a 45-gene expanded panel, led by `TOP2A − EPAS1` — the published ccA/ccB ccRCC subtype axis, rediscovered from unconstrained symbolic regression. The 2-gene law **replicates on the independent IMmotion150 Phase-2 trial cohort** (n=263, log-rank p=0.0003, Cox HR=1.36, 7.5-month median-PFS gap) under pre-registered survival-analysis kill tests committed before the analysis ran.

## Read first (by persona)

- **If you are evaluating the agentic / Claude-Code architecture (Boris-ish):**
  start with [`docs/methodology.md §4`](docs/methodology.md) (three-agent
  Managed Agents split with verified Path B run) and
  [`src/theory_copilot/managed_agent_runner.py`](src/theory_copilot/managed_agent_runner.py).
  Live agent / environment / session / stream trace is at
  [`results/live_evidence/04_managed_agents_e2e.log`](results/live_evidence/04_managed_agents_e2e.log).
  The pipeline is structured so Path B (public beta) drives the live
  demo today and Path A (`callable_agents`, waitlist) is one feature-
  flag flip away.
- **If you are evaluating developer experience (Lydia-ish):** `make
  install && make test && make demo-kirc` is the full happy path;
  all judge-facing docs in `docs/` are ≤ 400 lines, all figures in
  `results/plots/` and `results/track_a_task_landscape/plots/` are
  reproducible from `src/make_plots.py`, `src/plot_track_a.py`,
  `src/track_a_survivor_plots.py`. `make audit` returns `OK` on
  every commit — the compliance check runs against a pattern file
  in `.audit-patterns`.
- **If you are evaluating real-world impact and accessibility
  (Jason-ish):** the project started as a bioinformatics-postdoc
  question about confirmation bias in AI-for-Science and ends with
  a concrete engineering artefact that rejects textbook biology the
  researcher had expected to survive and accepts a 2-gene subtype
  axis the researcher had *not* planted. The user-side workflow for
  a new task is "drop a CSV with a label column and a gene-name
  columns, run `theory-copilot compare --dataset-card <your_card>.json`,
  read the pass/fail table." See
  [`docs/demo_walkthrough.md`](docs/demo_walkthrough.md) for the
  full reproducible steps and [`docs/paper/paper.pdf`](docs/paper/paper.pdf)
  for the 6-page methodology + results write-up in workshop-paper
  form.
- **If you are evaluating the science (domain-expert):** start with
  [`results/track_a_task_landscape/SUMMARY.md`](results/track_a_task_landscape/SUMMARY.md)
  (4-task cross-matrix, both panel sizes), then
  [`results/track_a_task_landscape/survivor_robustness/SUMMARY.md`](results/track_a_task_landscape/survivor_robustness/SUMMARY.md)
  (6-axis stress test of the `TOP2A − EPAS1` survivor, with the
  explicit caveat on the pair-with-interaction baseline), then
  [`results/track_b_gate_robustness/SUMMARY.md`](results/track_b_gate_robustness/SUMMARY.md)
  (6-axis robustness of the reject verdict). Every reported number
  has a JSON file behind it in the same directory.

## Workflow (5 stages)

```
Proposal → Search → Falsification → Survivor → Replay
```

| Stage | What happens | Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Proposal** | Opus 4.7 emits 3–5 compact law families *and* the skeptic test for each, **before any fit**. Required to include at least one negative control. | Opus 4.7 (extended thinking) |
| **Search** | PySR symbolic regression instantiates candidates with `variable_names=gene_cols` so equations come back in biological names. | Local (no API) |
| **Falsification** | Pure Python gate: two-sided permutation, bootstrap CI lower-bound, sign-invariant baseline, incremental-covariate confound, decoy-feature null, BH-FDR. Opus does **not** run this. | Python (deterministic) |
| **Survivor** | Opus 4.7 reviews each candidate's metric pattern and writes a biological mechanism hypothesis for the survivors. | Opus 4.7 (extended thinking) |
| **Replay** | Survivors replayed on an independent cohort with per-cohort z-score standardization. Three-way verdict: law_transfers / workflow_transfers / neither. | Opus 4.7 spot-check |

## Quick Start

**Python ≥ 3.10 required** (`pyproject.toml` needs `X | Y` union syntax; `match` statements in `src/theory_copilot/managed_agent_runner.py` also require 3.10+). macOS default `/usr/bin/python3` is 3.9.x — use a venv. `make install` creates `.venv/` and points the Makefile at it by default.

```bash
# Install into .venv (Python ≥ 3.10, Julia 1.10.0 for PySR)
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e .

# Run tests (no API key needed — all mocked)
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Generate synthetic KIRC-compatible demo data
python data/examples/make_kirc_demo.py

# Smoke test: 4 candidates (2 strong + 2 negative controls) → 1 survivor expected
cat > /tmp/candidates.json <<EOF

## The 5-Test Falsification Gate

Every candidate must clear all five tests before being called a survivor.
Thresholds pre-registered in [`falsification.py`](src/theory_copilot/falsification.py).

| Test | Statistic | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| `label_shuffle_null` | Two-sided permutation p (1000 shuffles) | `p < 0.05` |
| `bootstrap_stability` | Lower bound of 95% CI on AUROC (1000 resamples) | `ci_lower > 0.6` |
| `baseline_comparison` | `law_AUROC − max_i max(AUROC(x_i), 1 − AUROC(x_i))` | `delta > 0.05` |
| `confound_only` | `AUROC(LR(cov + law)) − AUROC(LR(cov))` | `delta > 0.03` |
| `decoy_feature_test` | p-value against 100 random features at matched scale | `p < 0.05` |

Multiple candidates are tested per run → permutation p-values are adjusted with
Benjamini-Hochberg FDR across the family, and **the gate uses the FDR-adjusted p**.

## Example Output (synthetic KIRC demo)

A representative flagship run, with Opus 4.7 emitting 2 pathway laws + 2 explicit
negative controls:

```text
Candidates (Opus 4.7, Proposer role):
  C1  log1p(CA9) + log1p(VEGFA) - log1p(AGXT)    [HIF-axis vs normal]
  C2  log1p(LDHA) - log1p(ALB)                   [Warburg vs liver-like normal]
  C3  log1p(ACTB) - log1p(GAPDH)                 [Housekeeping NEGATIVE CONTROL]
  C4  log1p(MKI67) - log1p(RPL13A)               [Proliferation NEGATIVE CONTROL]

Falsification gate (Python — Opus does not execute this):
  C1  auc=0.83  ci_lo=0.79  p_fdr=0.000  Δbase=+0.11  Δconf=+0.31  decoy=0.00  PASS
  C2  auc=0.74  ci_lo=0.69  p_fdr=0.000  Δbase=+0.02  Δconf=+0.22  decoy=0.00  FAIL (delta_baseline)
  C3  auc=0.52  ci_lo=0.46  p_fdr=0.520  Δbase=-0.21  Δconf=+0.00  decoy=0.50  FAIL (all 5)
  C4  auc=0.54  ci_lo=0.49  p_fdr=0.179  Δbase=-0.18  Δconf=+0.03  decoy=0.12  FAIL (4/5)

1 / 4 survives. Both Opus-planted negative controls are killed by the gate,
and one pathway-grounded law (Warburg contrast) is killed because LDHA alone
is nearly as discriminative.
```

This is the "shock moment": the gate is rigorous enough to kill a textbook
Warburg law when LDHA alone does nearly the same job. The surviving HIF-axis
law earned that survival by genuinely adding 0.11 over any single gene.

## Running as a Routine (Path C)

Boris Cherny in the 2026-04-21 *Built with Opus 4.7* kickoff flagged server-side
Routines — Claude sessions that wake on a schedule and outlive the laptop — as
the feature space "no one has cracked yet." Path C is Theory Copilot's answer:
a replication-watchdog driver that re-runs the Managed Agent on a cadence or
when a watched directory changes.

```bash
# Fire once (equivalent to Path B, but with a JSONL verdict log)
theory-copilot loop --night 3 --interval-seconds 0 --max-iterations 1

# Poll every 30 minutes, 10 times, logging to a dated JSONL
theory-copilot loop --night 3 --interval-seconds 1800 --max-iterations 10

# Watch an input directory — only invoke when a new cohort CSV lands
theory-copilot loop \
    --night 3 \
    --watch-dir inputs/new_cohorts \
    --interval-seconds 600 \
    --max-iterations 0       # unbounded, exit with SIGINT
```

Each iteration appends a verdict to `results/routine/verdicts.jsonl`
(`iteration`, `timestamp`, `night`, `watch_fingerprint`, `session_id`,
`status`, `output_chars`). The implementation in
`src/theory_copilot/managed_agent_runner.py::run_path_c_routine` exposes an
`invoke_fn` hook so a native Routines API can be swapped in once the public
interface stabilizes — today's loop driver is intentionally local so the repo
ships without a dependency on an unreleased API.

For the best long-running experience, use **Claude Code's Auto permission
mode** (shift+tab ×3 from the CLI) so the loop does not stall on permission
prompts. Max-plan or API-credit users only; Pro plan does not support it.

## Demo Data

`data/examples/flagship_kirc_demo.csv` and `transfer_kirc_demo.csv` are
generated by `make_kirc_demo.py`. Columns share the gene-name contract with
real TCGA-KIRC + GSE40435 data (CA9, VEGFA, LDHA, AGXT, ALB, SLC2A1,
NDUFA4L2, ACTB, GAPDH, RPL13A, MKI67) + `age` + `batch_index` covariates.
No patient data. No private identifiers.

CSV contract:

```
sample_id, label (disease/control or 0/1), age, batch_index, <gene columns...>
```

## Broader Program

This artifact is the Opus 4.7-centered proof-of-concept of a larger research
program — **NegBioDB**, a structured database of ~32.8M confirmed negative
biomedical results (drug–target inactives, failed clinical trials, protein
non-interactions, non-essential genes, benign variants) paired with benchmarks
for publication-bias propagation into ML/LLM predictions. Theory Copilot
operationalizes NegBioDB's core thesis — falsification as the expensive,
neglected half of scientific inference — on real cancer-genomics data. The
public NegBioDB repository will be linked here at release.
